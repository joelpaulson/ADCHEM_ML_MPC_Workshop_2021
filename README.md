# ADCHEM Workshop 2021

This page contains the code associated with the ADCHEM 2021 Workshop on Machine Learning and Model Predictive Control. 

The code is written in Matlab and is broken down into 3 parts: (1) learning plant-model mismatch using Gaussian processes, 
(2) learning deep neural network approximations of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) laws, and (3) learning
the optimal NMPC tuning parameters using constrained Bayesian optimization. 

The following packages are required
